 ### Clarification

I prefer compact stereo speakers without subwoofers. Powered speakers are fine. Do note this in comparison table. You can include mass market brands such as Trust, Logitech and others. Focus on wide availability in Europe especially in Eastern Europe notably Latvian electronic retailers such as euronics.lv, rdveikals.lv and other Latvian retail and e-stores. Provide sources for each speaker in your comparison table.

To help choose a **2.0 stereo** computer speaker (powered, no subwoofer) in the €30–€60 range, here is a comparison of several available options in Eastern Europe (with a focus on Latvia). For context, the **Logitech Z313** 2.1 system (with subwoofer) is included, though it is a 2.1 setup and not the preferred 2.0 format. All prices are current in Latvia and links to local retailers are provided.

**Notes:** All the above are **powered speakers** (with built-in amplifiers). “USB-powered” means they draw power from a USB port (or phone charger) instead of a wall outlet, which is convenient but typically yields lower wattage. AC-powered speakers can generally output more volume/bass. Bluetooth-enabled models can pair wirelessly with phones or laptops, in addition to a wired 3.5 mm connection, allowing versatility (e.g., streaming music from a phone).

## Key Differences and Recommendations

* **Subwoofer vs No Subwoofer:** The **Logitech Z313** includes a subwoofer (2.1 configuration), which gives it much stronger bass response than the 2.0 speakers. However, it also means more cables and a bulky subwoofer unit. Since you prefer a 2.0 setup without a sub, the other models (Z207, Pebble V3, R980T, Trust Asto) are likely more suitable. The Z313 was included for context because it’s a popular set around €50–60; it delivers booming bass for movies/games, but its satellite speakers are not as clear in the mid-range as the dedicated 2.0 systems.

* **Audio Quality:** In general, **Edifier R980T** offers the best sound fidelity in this group – its larger drivers and wooden cabinets produce clearer mids/highs and a surprisingly punchy bass for a subwoofer-less system. It’s a great choice if you value audio quality and don’t mind the slightly larger speaker size on your desk. **Logitech Z207** also earned praise for balanced and room-filling sound given its compact size, making it a solid all-around choice, especially if you want Bluetooth support. The **Creative Pebble V3**, while smaller and USB-powered, is frequently recommended for close-range desktop use: it has very clear treble and midrange detail for voices and general listening. Its main limitation is bass output – the Pebble’s passive radiators help, but it cannot match the low-end of the larger AC-powered speakers. The **Trust Asto soundbar** is the most space-saving option and is fine for basic audio (YouTube, system sounds, etc.), but with only 6 W RMS it sounds thinner and won’t get as loud or deep in bass as the others – it trades audio richness for a slim form factor.

* **Power and Volume:** USB-powered models (like Creative Pebble V3, Trust Asto) are very convenient (no wall plug needed), but they generally produce less power. They are best for small rooms or desktop use at moderate volume. The AC-powered models (Logitech Z313, Z207, Edifier R980T) can reach higher volumes and fuller sound. For instance, the Edifier R980T (24 W RMS) and Logitech Z313 (25 W RMS) can comfortably fill a bedroom or office with sound, whereas the Pebble V3 (8 W RMS) or Trust Asto (6 W RMS) are intended for near-field listening at your PC. If you like to listen at higher volumes or want some bass punch, leaning toward the higher wattage (AC-powered) speakers is advisable.

* **Bluetooth and Connectivity:** Consider whether you need wireless playback. The **Logitech Z207** supports simultaneous Bluetooth connections (up to 2 devices) *plus* a wired input, making it very versatile for a PC + phone setup. The **Creative Pebble V3** also includes Bluetooth 5.0, which is handy for occasional wireless use, though you’ll primarily use it connected to your PC via USB or 3.5mm. The other options (Edifier R980T, Trust Asto, Logitech Z313) are wired-only – you’d plug them into the PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack (or RCA outputs in Edifier’s case). If streaming music from a phone or having fewer wires is a priority, a Bluetooth-equipped model (Z207 or Pebble V3) is recommended. Otherwise, if you only need a wired PC speaker, you might prioritize pure audio quality or price over wireless features.

* **Availability in Latvia:** All listed models are **widely available in Latvia** through major retailers. For example, **RD Electronics (rdveikals.lv)** and **Euronics Latvia** carry most of these models (as cited above). Logitech and Trust products are also found in other electronics stores and online marketplaces in the region. **Creative** and **Edifier** models are available via local distributors and IT stores (like Dateks, 1a.lv, etc.), though they may not be on display in smaller brick-and-mortar shops. Before purchasing, you can check stock at retailers like Euronics or RD Electronics (links provided) to either order online or pick up in-store. Pricing in Latvia for these speakers tends to fall in the noted range, with occasional sales – for instance, the Z313 often hovers around €55–60, the Z207 around €50–55, and the Creative Pebble V3 in the mid-€30s.

## **Recommendations:**

* If you want **the best audio quality** and don’t mind slightly larger speakers on your desk, **Edifier R980T** is highly recommended for its sound clarity and bass. It’s at the top of the budget but still within €60, and it will give a richer listening experience for music and games.

* If you value **wireless versatility** or a more compact form, **Logitech Z207** is an excellent choice. It provides very balanced sound (for its size) and the convenience of Bluetooth for about \~€50. It’s a great all-purpose PC speaker set for the price.

* For a **budget-friendly ultra-compact** setup, the **Creative Pebble V3** is a strong contender. At around €35–40, it’s hard to beat in terms of sound-per-euro for small USB-powered speakers. It’s perfect for close-up use with a laptop or desktop, and still offers Bluetooth as a bonus. Just keep in mind the limited bass – it’s best for near-field listening, not pumping bass in a large room.

* The **Trust Asto soundbar** is an option to consider if your desk space is very limited (it tucks under a monitor) or if you strictly want to stay at \~€30. It’s easy to set up (single USB for power, one cable for audio) and avoids clutter. However, due to its lower power, it’s recommended **only if** your expectations are modest (voice, general computer sounds, light music). For a more robust sound in the same price bracket, a 2.0 set like the Creative Pebble or a slightly higher-end Trust model with bigger drivers would outperform the Asto.

In summary, **all the listed speakers will work with a standard PC (via 3.5mm jack or USB)** and are sold by Latvian retailers. Your choice should balance how much you prioritize audio quality vs. features like Bluetooth or compact size. For the **best audio within €60**, Edifier R980T leads with its fuller sound, while Logitech’s offerings (Z207 or even the Z313 if you decided a subwoofer is acceptable) provide very good value and reliability. Creative’s Pebble V3 is a standout mini speaker for those who want to save money or space while still getting clear stereo sound. By considering the above points, you can pick the speaker setup that best fits your needs. Enjoy your new audio setup!
