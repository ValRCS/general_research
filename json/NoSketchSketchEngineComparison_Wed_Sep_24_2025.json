It provides access to massive text corpora and powerful analytical functions through a graphical user interface.\n\n#### Primary Uses\n\n*   Analyzing word behavior in very large, pre-existing text corpora.\n*   Generating \"word sketches,\" which are one-page summaries of a word's collocations and grammatical patterns.\n*   Finding concordance lines (Key Word in Context) for specific search queries.\n*   Extracting multi-word expressions, terminology, and keywords.\n*   Comparing word usage across different corpora or sub-corpora.\n*   Creating a personal corpus by uploading text or using the integrated web crawler.\n\n#### Limitations\n\n*   It is a subscription-based service, which can be a cost barrier.\n*   As a cloud-based platform, it may not be suitable for working with highly sensitive or private data.\n*   Users have limited control over the back-end processing and server environment.\n*   The web interface, while powerful, can have a steep learning curve for new users.\n\n### NoSketch Engine\n\nNoSketch Engine is the open-source, local version of the software that powers Sketch Engine. It allows researchers to build a corpus query engine on their own server or computer.\n\n#### Primary Uses\n\n*   Building and querying custom corpora on a local machine or private server.\n*   Analyzing sensitive or proprietary text data in a secure environment.\n*   Integrating a powerful corpus engine into custom digital humanities tools and applications via its API.\n*   Learning the fundamentals of corpus engine architecture without subscription costs.\n*   Gaining complete control over corpus compilation, annotation, and indexing.\n\n#### Limitations\n\n*   It requires significant technical expertise to install, configure, and maintain.\n*   Users must supply, compile, and manage all of their own corpus data.\n*   It does not come with pre-built corpora.\n*   Getting advanced features like word sketches to work requires deep linguistic and technical knowledge to write \"sketch grammars.\"\n*   The standard web interface (`Bonito`) is more basic than the commercial version."

      "reasoning": "**Clarifying NoSketch Engine features**\n\nIn NoSketch Engine, the \"word sketches\" feature is accessible via Bonito if you have the appropriate Sketch Grammar file (.skg) for your language. I'm a bit unclear about whether the algorithms are proprietary or if the original \"word sketches\" algorithm is open-source. I believe NoSketch Engine focuses on concordancing, frequency lists, collocations, and more, but it lacks some features that Sketch Engine offers, like large corpora and automatic processes. It’s self-hosted and requires specific setups.**Comparing Sketch Engine and NoSketch Engine**\n\nSketch Engine is a commercial service, either SaaS or on-premises, with extensive corpora for many languages and a user-friendly interface. It offers tools for building corpora, tagging, lemmatization, and tokenization through a comprehensive toolchain. WebBootCaT helps build web corpora, while TenTen provides huge crawled corpora and GDEX offers useful dictionary examples. For research in digital humanities, it’s used in areas like corpus linguistics and discourse analysis. However, NoSketch has challenges, such as a steep learning curve and limited documentation.**Reviewing Performance and Features**\n\nThe performance of a C++ engine is promising, with potential for scaling to large corpora, though memory and configuration might be challenging. Multi-user management is somewhat limited, along with security and backup features. For Sketch Engine, costs include subscription fees and data privacy concerns for sensitive corpora, and there are restrictions on customization and sharing. Input formats include vertical lists and CQL. NoSketch Engine, on the other hand, lacks built-in cloud corpora, automatic crawling, and tagging, which results in a smaller ecosystem and uncertain maintenance status.**Explaining Word Sketch Features**\n\nThe Word Sketch feature has limited support, depending on the availability of sketch grammars, and its coverage is not as extensive as in Sketch Engine. It's important to note that NoSketch is GPL licensed. The Manatee-open and Bonito are also GPL-compatible. Sketch Engine, on the other hand, is commercial but offers academic discounts.\n\nI should include a section on when to choose each engine, data pipeline tips, and mention their primary uses and limitations for digital humanities researchers. Integration with digital humanities workflows, reproducibility, scripting, and APIs are essential points too. Lastly, NoSketch is maintained by Lexical Computing and is older than Sketch Engine.**Structuring the Comparison Document**\n\nI want to ensure we address installation complexity for NoSketch. I think a structured approach would help make everything clear.\n\nI can divide the document into sections:\n- **Overview:** I'll include both NoSketch Engine and Sketch Engine.\n- **Primary uses:** Separate bullet points for each engine's uses.\n- **Key features:** This could be optional.\n- **Limitations:** Discuss limitations for both NoSketch and Sketch Engine.\n- **Data, deployment, and licensing.**\n- **When to choose which.**\n- **Interoperability and APIs.**\n- **Caveats for reproducible digital humanities research.**\n\nI'll keep bullets short, limit heavy formatting, and be cautious about claims regarding features like \"GDEX\" and \"Thesaurus.\"",

      "reasoning": "**Considering the Alternatives**\n\nI'm breaking down the user's request, focusing on finding alternatives to Sketch Engine for digital humanities researchers. The goal is to understand the context: who they are, their needs, and what the prompt is asking me to do. I'm moving forward with understanding how to cater my response to this target.\n\n\n**Defining Key Features**\n\nI'm refining the \"Major Corpus Analysis Feature\" column. It's essential for the Markdown table. I am starting to make a list for each feature, which will include: Concordancing, Collocations, Keyword Analysis, Frequency Lists, and N-gram Analysis. The goal is to have a clear definition for each tool.\n\n\n**Mapping Data to the Table**\n\nI'm currently wrestling with AntConc. It is a desktop app, not server-based like the others. I'll need a note about how this affects the hosting options, as I continue to build out the table. I'm going to start by including AntConc because it's so widely used.\n\n\n**Refining Table Entries**\n\nI'm now looking at the 'price' column for each alternative. The open-source options are straightforward, but I'll need to research the pricing tiers for Sketch Engine and WMatrix as of September 2025. I'm also making some assumptions about the ongoing development of the open source tools.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Feature List**\n\nI'm taking a closer look at the feature list. While I previously had a column for \"Web-based GUI,\" I think I'll add a note in the \"Hosting Options\" column. I'll probably have to adjust the list I previously created in \"Major Corpus Analysis Feature\" to fit my new goal.\n\n\n**Evaluating Web Interface Availability**\n\nI'm now focused on the \"Web-based GUI\" column and realizing the nuances. While some tools offer a full web interface, others offer programmatic access, and some offer desktop-only solutions. I'll refine the descriptions to reflect the actual functionality of each offering.\n\n\n**Creating the Markdown Table**\n\nI'm now populating the Markdown table. I am taking the various tools I've listed and beginning to list the features, such as \"Concordancing\" and \"Collocation Analysis,\" in the table. The goal is to create a solid comparison of their key features.\n\n\n**Evaluating API Access**\n\nI'm now assessing the \"API / Programmatic Access\" column. For Sketch Engine and NoSketch Engine, this is straightforward. CQPweb's command-line interface is less of an API. The Python ecosystem, of course, is entirely programmatic. This helps refine the table.\n\n\n",

      "reasoning": "**Creating a markdown table for engines**\n\nI'm reminded that I need to create a markdown table including NoSketch and Sketch Engines, among other alternatives, with a focus on open-source options. The user's request specifies the time frame as September 2025, but I have to be careful, since my knowledge only goes up to October 2024. It's important not to invent any new products beyond that cutoff. I’ll list known alternatives like Corpus Workbench and BlackLab with their details, noting that some info might be outdated.**Detailing engine features and alternatives**\n\nI’m outlining features for various engines, including token annotations, fast concordancing, span queries, and metadata filtering. For instance, ANNIS is open-source and allows multi-layer annotations, developed by HU Berlin and licensed under Apache 2.0.\n\nKorAP, also open-source, acts as a search engine for large corpora and supports query languages like Cosmas II and Poliqarp. It’s essential to specify that KorAP consists of components with different licenses, like Krill under Apache 2.0, so I’ll need to be diligent about that!**Summarizing open-source tools**\n\nI can mention that several tools are open-source under licenses like BSD, MIT, or Apache. For example, Korp from Språkbanken is also open-source (MIT). It serves as a front-end for backend corpora and offers features like concordance, frequency over time, word pictures, collocations, trends, and part-of-speech filters. \n\nAlthough AntConc is a common desktop tool, it's actually freeware rather than open-source. TXM, on the other hand, is an open-source text analysis tool, providing various features and actively maintained until 2022.**Reviewing relevant tools**\n\nI’m considering the TXM Portal, which runs on Linux through the CQP engine. Then we have Voyant Tools, which is web-based and open-source (GPL3). It’s self-hostable via Java and offers features like word frequencies, collocations, and trends, but it’s not designed for very large corpora.\n\nPoliqarp is another option, as an open-source search engine under GPL, with positional attributes and a CQP-like query language. It’s self-hostable and used by the Polish National Corpus.**Compiling tools for text analysis**\n\nI’m gathering information about various text analysis tools and their features. For instance, TXM Portal runs on Linux and supports corpus management. Voyant Tools is web-based and open-source (GPL3), offering functionalities for smaller corpora, like word frequencies and collocations.\n\nThere are also options like Poliqarp for corpus searching and several other applications, but they might not all fit as major alternatives to NoSketch and Sketch Engines. I’ll need to organize that into a markdown table with key details like licensing, pricing, hosting, and major features for clarity. It's crucial to provide a clear and structured format.**Structuring text analysis tools**\n\nI'm outlining how to structure a markdown table for text analysis tools, defining columns like Product, License, Price, Hosting options, and various features like Concordance and Collocations. I’ve identified tools such as NoSketch Engine and Sketch Engine, along with notable alternatives like CWB + CQPweb, ANNIS, and Voyant Tools.\n\nI'll ensure to clarify licenses and features accurately. I aim to summarize each tool with short, clear entries and maintain a focus on what the user specifically requested in this table format. It's crucial to keep everything concise and organized!**Creating a features table**\n\nI'm setting up a markdown table for various text analysis tools. I think it's a good idea to add a note indicating that the information is current as of October 2024. To ensure clarity, I'll include features like Concordance, Collocations, and whether each tool supports various functionalities. \n\nI need to be careful with licenses and prices; I'll consolidate features to avoid overflow in the table. After completing the table, I may also include brief notes to clarify any details!**Creating comparison table**\n\nI’m putting together a comparison table for various text analysis tools. I need to ensure consistent values like \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and \"Partial.\" I should add a minimal header noting that the information is valid as of September 2025, but I’ll keep disclaimers brief.\n\nFor entries, I’ll include details on licenses, pricing, and hosting options, among other features. I think it’s also important to confirm capabilities like concordance, POS/Lemma support, and API availability. Let’s finalize that table!",
